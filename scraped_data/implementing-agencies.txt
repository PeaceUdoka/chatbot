Responsibility for project implementation rests with the Federal Ministry of Education (FME), specifically the Technology and Science Education Department (TSED), National Board of Technical Education (NBTE) as well as the state government of the six participating states. Each of these project implementing units will implement parts of the IDEAS Project depending on their institutional mandate, whereas the FME/TSED assumes the overall implementation supervision and coordination. For the purpose of implementing the project activities, the FME/ TSED has formed a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), NBTE has formed a Project Management Unit (PMU), and each of the participating state governments have formed State Project Implementation Units (SPIUs).
Responsibility for project oversight rests with the National Project Steering Committee (NPSC) and the State Project Steering Committee (SPSCs) in the initially participating states. The NPSC is headed by the Minister of Education and composed of key public and private (industry) stakeholders, as well as representatives from SPSCs. It will be in charge of overall strategic and policy guidance for project implementation and will review important progress and implementation reports. SPSCs will be in charge of guiding the implementation of project activities in their state.
