Background
Informal apprenticeship training is widespread in Nigeria and presumably the largest and most accessible training system in the country. However, it tends to be trapped in a vicious cycle of low skills and low productivity in the informal sector. Inspired by ample experience with strengthening informal apprenticeship training in other African countries, the IDEAS project aims to develop “structured apprenticeship training” in selected informal sector clusters across the participating states.The planned interventions are supposed to:To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, a comprehensive support package will be provided to selected MCPs and their apprentices in a defined range of trades/occupational areas in the states. While component activities are coordinated by the PMU, an array of stakeholders will be involved at different steps of the implementation. Apart from the MCPs themselves and their apprentices, these include the SPIUs, chambers, trade associations, training centres, the NBTE as regulatory authority, awarding bodies and sector skills councils. Furthermore, different service providers (consultants) will be involved in the preparation, implementation and monitoring of component activities.
